#Introduction to Digital Circuit:

##Logic operations and logic gates:
Draw circuits using cascading design (commonly used for large circuit)

Example:
![Half- BitAdder](https://github.com/ksuhartono97/Class-Notes/blob/COMP2611/COMP2611/resources/unit1/halfbitadder.png)

In circuits  a filled dot (.) in the lines signify a split in the circuit (it carries the same signal)
Meanwhile an unfilled dot(0) signify the input signal or output signal
For **representation** only

Electronic signal is digital, thus can be represented with binaries (0 = deasserted, 1 = asserted)
>Typical voltage: 
>| 1: 2.4V-2.9 V |

>| **0 : 0V-0.5 V** | ![enter image description here]
