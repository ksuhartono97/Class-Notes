#Introduction to Digital Circuit:

##Logic operations and logic gates:
Draw circuits using cascading design (commonly used for large circuit)

In circuits  a filled dot (.) in the lines signify a split in the circuit (it carries the same signal)
Meanwhile an unfilled dot(0) signify the input signal or output signal
For **representation** only

Electronic signal is digital, thus can be represented with binaries (0 = deasserted, 1 = asserted)
Typical voltage:
