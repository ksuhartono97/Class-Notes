# Prospects for the Relationship

Predicting future is difficult

- Complex systems

  - many components with complicated interrelationships
  - or few components but unpredictable

- Beware of false certainty : people who absolutely believe (or absolutely certain)
- Make predictions probabilistic : assign a probability to an event happening.
- Generate alternative outcomes : due to possibility of other events.

"Imagine the unfamiliar" even though it has never been seen before. There is a difference between being unable to imagine and denying the reality!

## Categorizing Scenarios

- Must still assign a probability, cannot assume a scenario will certainly happen.

Cocktail party generalization : something that is very useful, but is not yet theory/truth. As in something that sound plausible but not working everywhere.

The client matters : will ask you the "so what" questions.

Example : x% chance of rain tomorrow, but so what? Depends on who you are.

- You are never outside : forecast doesn't matter, irrelevant.

Which is the better forecaster?

Foxes, due to having multiple theories can identify different outcomes, contingencies and probabilities. Predictions are more accurate because they assigned a lot of outcomes.

> Superordinate goals : common goals that are so powerful that they force rivals to ally with each other.
