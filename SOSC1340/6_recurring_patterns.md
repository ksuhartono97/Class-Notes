# Recurring Patterns and Divergent Narratives

History is necessary to understand the present and future. "Like all social phenomenons, relations internationally are path dependent" (depends on the paths you took before). Historical constraints may limit the decisions in present or future.

History : creates stories. Examples:

- June 4 (Tiananmen) : created bad impressions of China
- Divergent narratives, different perceptions/interpretations of the situation, selective stories may affect certain groups of people differently.

Structural comparison of Historical Cases:

- Deterrence : to prevent another country from doing something.
- Coercive diplomacy: use force to force some other country to do something you want to happen.
- Analysis: look at the cases and judge how similar it is to current situation.

Mistaken lessons:

- Overly simplistic patterns (reductionism) : Too much of a simplification, reducing the size and complexity.

## Patterns of History

Arnold Toynbee, said that there are patterns in history. They don't exactly repeat themselves, but there are patterns. Most commonly cited historical patterns:

- Continuity : what continues(continuous) or recurs (discontinuous)
- Change: The opposite of continue, something must differ / change.

  - Stage theories: Inevitable progress, someday a society will eventually progress to a certain point. Or eventual decline, the idea that one day all societies will fall.
  - Cycles and tides: History comes back in similar things, generally similar, although details may vary (History rhymes - Mark Twain)
  - Revolutionary: data began to come in, that changed understanding of past patterns.

## Continuities in US China

Things that stayed constant in the relationship:

- Fateful ties: each country things that the other is profoundly important to it one way or the other.
- America's desire to change China : a story of failure, due to their exaggeration of their ability to change China.
- Interest: similar interest of having access to China on equal terms. Also, favorable balance in Asia, America doesn't want to see Asia dominated by any power or hostile power.

## Cycles in US China

- "Love Hate" relationship
- Regression to the mean: eventually it will return to a point (US presidents usually will have different opinions of China on what they want to do. But eventually they'll all return to backing off status).
