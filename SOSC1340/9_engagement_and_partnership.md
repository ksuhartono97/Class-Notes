# Comprehensive Engagement & Constructive Strategic Partnership

Volatility in US China Relationship : made worse due to June 4 (Tiananmen)

MFN status removed/conditions for renewal : were not carried on

Fall of Berlin Wall and Soviet Union caused uncertain international context.

Fragile relationship shaken by another crisis: Taiwan Strait Crisis 1995-1996 and Lee Deng Hui going for reelection.

China deployed forces to threaten, US responded causing high tensions.

China responded to US show of force by saying that they can destroy the US's foothild in Asia. China also showed(demonstrated) that they can do a great deal of damage to Taiwan.

US China Relations greatly shaken up by this crisis.

## "Comprehensive Engagement"

US China was in "Post June 4" relationship : not very good relations, unstable.

US came to the understanding that China won't change/collapse. Have to reengage, thus policy of "comprehensive engagement": discuss a comprehensive range of issues

- Human rights
- Trades
- Military and security issues.

Americans didn't think of translation problem. Engagement has multiple meanings. There is a lot of difficulty in translating to Chinese.

## "Constructive Strategic Partnership"

- Proposed Partnership (US) : backed off to cooperation
- Chinese was very excited, proposed "strategic partnership", an important and long term cooperation across many issues, to try and get out of isolation due to June 4.
- US responded, strategic partnership implies there is an enemy, constructive is added to show that it is a positive relationship
- This process of defining the terms is trying to define the relationship
- Build toward is added : implies something that they didn't have earlier and are trying to get back.

Japanese panicked : character for "strategic" implied war, they weren't happy.

Build toward was **not emphasized** (is only a goal), however people thought this is already true.

Thus the conclusion of this program was that it was badly translated and explained to the US.

This program also had disappointing results, NATO aircraft bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade : was not accidental, it was a mistake, the US thought it was a Serbian embassy.
