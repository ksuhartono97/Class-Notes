# Normalization and Honeymoon

Arguments can be made for both side, for US / China in the normalization.

On the US side, they had to give up a lot of things, as in the case of Taiwan.

On China side, they felt they were forced to accept an array of ongoing arrangements between the US and Taiwan which they did not like.

Many Americans felt that China got more in the deal regarding Taiwan. Thus they created the Taiwan Relations Act to show a deeper commitment from the US. However, China is disappointed because of this act.

**Normalization** implies normalized diplomatic relationship. However, not yet achieved a normalized social/economic relationship. Due to problems from the past such as:

- Embargo (from the past) that had been written into law : "Non market economies that did not allow the freedom of emigration" are not allowed to trade with the US.

  - Was originally designated for the Soviets, however China also falls into this category
  - "Most Favorite Nation" (MFN) status : extra benefits due to national interest from the US.

Deng Xiaoping's visit is controversial, it was seen as a great success however there are still protests going on during his visit. In a sense this visit is the beginning of the honeymoon. However, honeymoon only began after the August 1982 Communique that modified the Taiwan Relations Act to better satisfy China (even then China was still not satisfied with the result), and Reagan's visit to China.

Special trade terms with Russia, must be purely equal or reciprocal. As in if you want something from us then you must give us something of equal value. However this was not done in the case of China because the US wants these trades to happen so that China will open up.

Reagan thought that China is moving away from communism (wishful thinking). American's thought that China had abandoned communism. Though it may be true that they did abandon a lot of communist views that Mao set up, they didn't abandon Leninism.

On the other hand, China thought US had stopped being "anti-communist" and is willing to see their ideology as an equal.

## Honeymoon

This honeymoon / period of good relations was brief. Disappointment on both sides happened due to high expectations set by each side upon the other. And in due time, Americans started seeing more of the negative side of China. Americans feared that the negative things in China would happen in the US. Example of these: Chinese planned family, which means forced birth control (abortion).

US is a **religious** country

Americans and China saw trade relations as a possible positive gain because of the complementaries. There began to be a lot of trade negotiations with China, because China is getting a trade surplus (US keeps buying stuff from China) however US went into deficit (China didn't buy anything from US). Therefore, trade between them started becoming a problem.

Russia began to accommodate China because they didn't want US to be really strong with China. China also wanted this so they can have more leverage against the US. Thus the American's viewed this relation as China doing worrisome things.
