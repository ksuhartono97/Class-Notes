# From Honeymoon to Near Divorce

The weakening foundations of the relationship:

- Soviet hegemony threat weakened : known due to Soviets reaching out to fix relations with US and China
- Both sides had complaints about their trade relationship due to deficits. And also the US's surprise at China's ability to produce consumer products.
- Growing concern about policies: religion ban, abortion, spiritual pollution, etc in China. Also fear of China's role in international arms war because they were selling missiles to other countries, causing US's security to start getting complicated.

## Effects of Tiananmen

Caused perceptions of China in the US to get worse. China realized and ordered the termination of the broadcasts of the incident.

### On public opinion

Immediate and dramatic and the change was a lasting change. After normalization there is a huge increase in favorable attitude towards China (until just before Tiananmen) however after Tiananmen, the percentage flipped around. After 1989, it stayed constant (bad perception of China).

### On policy

Bush Sr. attempted damage control on the whole thing, even though it only failed and worsened the situation. Public opinion at the time was strong and they wanted to express American anger towards the atrocities that were being committed in China.

Bush's attempts:

- Make a phone call to Deng Xiaoping: refused
- Nixon and Kissinger's new mission, authorized by Bush to show that Bush still cares about China. Failed, didn't increase approval of China in the eyes of US citizens.
- Scowcroft and Eagleburger Missions: General Scowcroft, the national security advisor of the US at the time, was sent in a secret mission. It was secret due to a sanction with China, no exchanges was to be made with China. Result inconclusive, too many issues to discuss, no success. There was a second mission caused strong and infuriating responses from the US public. Very negative reactions.

> Foreign policy is a two level game. One with the foreign representatives, one with the political base (it must be maintained).

Thus the US was forced to make sanctions, some are required by law:

- Vote against loans to China in World Bank
- Cut off government aid to China
- Cannot provide military aid and information

> Due to Americans viewing China's act as a gross violation of human rights

Chinese students lobbied first Congress and Bill Clinton to:

- Let Chinese students and scholars stay in the US, don't have to leave after finished studying.
- Not have to renew the Most Favorite Nations status every year, it was made like this to deny Chinese people easy entry into the US.

## Relationship Bottoms out

There was some sort of normalization and smoothening of the issues due to:

- Fang Lizhi's departure (a person who sought refuge in the US, China had been trying to get him out of US back to China) allowed relaxation in the relationship.
- Chinese kind of approved US Invasion of Iraq (abstained from voting against it)
- Increased official contacts between US and China: showed reduction in severity of the previously established sanctions
- Relaxation of other sanctions: US allies lobbied US to lift sanctions, such as Europe and Japan. Japan is good friends with China. Japan is worried that if the West has a frozen relationship with China, and then they will have to take sides. Which is something that they do not want. They wanted US China relationship to be "not too hot or too cold but just right". As in not too close not too strained, but just right.

Avoiding confrontation over MFN status: Clinton announced an executive order that he would not issue MFN to China in the following year if there is no significant change in China's human right record. Clinton then backed away the next year by saying that it is in the interests of the US to keep relations with China. Not enough US leverage.

Great mistrust on both sides, caused US China relationship to become fragile. Burdened by mutual disappointment.
