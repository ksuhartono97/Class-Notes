# Different Political Systems and Political Values

## Narratives

Patterns weaved into a story

Images can play a major point in the narrative, easy to remember and more powerful (compared to text representation or verbal representation)

Become part of the identity of a country. If threatened, it means that they would feel that their existence is threatened (existential threat).

Relationships are not often viewed in the same way by the participants. It may vary according to POV.

Competing narratives: different views of the same thing.

> No single narrative that is unchanging and everyone agrees to.

### American narrative

View of itself: Shining example of freedom. City on the hill that inspires others to follow the same values.

Is US in decline or is it simply self-reflection / improvement to the master American narrative. A lot of debate on this one.

About China: changed over time. Have a basis in fact, however their view of China is not entirely true. Selective on facts and ignore some alternative facts in their views.

### Chinese narrative

View of itself : the greatest continuous civilization in the history of mankind.

> US and China both view themselves as the greatest (super similar)

> Our better days are behind us, implies that something went wrong, now we're trying to make our country great again.

Humiliated by the West and Japan (has this changed yet?)

About US: They are somewhat better than other imperialists because:

- Doesn't seek territory
- Provided assistance
- Built infrastructure

However, they aligned with the wrong Chinese government and didn't back off until communist victory. They also engaged in policies that "attacked China". Public opinion divided ("Similar to US's opinion of China")

### Consequences

US expects gratitude from China but doesn't get it. Due to China feeling you helped us because of your own reasons. Therefore, there is no need to thank you.

China wants to be respected. Also doesn't get it.

## Institutions, Assumptions, and values

Political:

- US: More pluralistic, more input from below, more mediums of expression. Aspect of sharing of power between government branches and competition of power between parties
- China: Totalitarian, control every aspect of life. Less input from below, most common form of this are peasant rebellions

US policy more volatile (due to spread of power), whereas China is more coordinated (due to centralized power)

Partial institutional convergence

- Professionalization of those agencies: not trusted, too sympathetic to their country. And opinions are usually extremely similar to each other.
- Influences on government decision making (where do they come from)

Both are great powers: Both regard themselves as hegemonies, the dominant power in the region, expects **respect and deference** from their neighbors (due to their strength and power).

Assumptions about international politics:

- China is more realist: you are on your own, there is no one to help you. You must take care of yourself.
- US is more liberal: Build institutions that benefit all.

> China is trying to present itself as more liberal, to gain more legitimacy (due to liberalism gaining more legitimacy).

Both are moralistic, they believe in their own values.

Both have different core values:

- Domestically: one is individualistic, the other is more collective
- Internationally

Both have international dreams:

- The American dream : staying ahead of other nations
- The Chinese dream: catching up to other nations
