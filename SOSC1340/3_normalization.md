# From Detente to Rapprochment to Normalization

China policy is a "third rail" if US politics for a decade in the sense that people who touch the issue are usually eliminated. The Korean war froze this China policy.

The Soviet Factor: militarization of Sino Soviet conflict
along a contested border at a time of domestic turmoil in China

Breshnev doctrine: Soviet Union has the right to intervene if there is a communist nation that started to sway from what is seen as the correct view of communism or a communist ideology by the Soviets.

China is a swing factor in determining the influences between the two largest superpowers of the world at the time, US and the Soviets. Whichever side China joined, it will tip the balance towards that side. Illustration of China as "one-pound" weight that can influence the balance between two "one-tonne" weights.

## Signs of change
Kissinger and Nixon visits China for the Shanghai Communique. Kissinger's trip led to Nixon's trip.

Nixon's notes: the real reason of going to China was China and Soviets. No mention of Vietnam in his notes.

>Nixon's notes were written on his plane ride to China.

Shanghai Communique: one of the founding documents in the US-China relationship. During this time, the US focused on talking to China about what they agree and disagree. However, all disagreements were negotiated until they reached an agreeable point. Areas of agreement:
- To end the embargo, to have normal relations between the two countries
- No power should gain hegemony in Asia Pacific. Not US, not Soviets, not Japan. Chinese were nervous that Japan may still want to take its former colony (Taiwan). They need assurance from US that while working to prevent the rise of Soviets, Japan must not rise to power in Asia.
- Taiwan is a province of China (what China wants, according to the US, Taiwan's status is undetermined after WW2). No Power shall interfere with the liberation of Taiwan (all must be left to be dealt with internally by China). US must pull troops from Taiwan and oppose any movement that suggested that Taiwan becomes free from China.

America's response: The US refrained from saying a lot of things regarding Taiwan and China. Often only acknowledging things. Language is kept as vague as possible.

No one knew how Nixon would be received in China. Nixon's trip to China had been greatly successful, negotiated the Communique, and other agreements that pleased China. However there are still some uncertainties:
- What about the Soviets: "Win-win" situation for US and China, however who wins more? Absolute gain vs relative gain. People saw the importance of relative gain. China is concerned that the US is getting more out of the agreement (only using China as a stepping stone against Moscow)
- What to do about Taiwan

Normalization took a long time because:
- Chinese demands were tough : however China must also compromise to some US policies
- Each side (US and Taiwan) still maintained a form of bilateral relationship through the use of the American Institute in Taiwan and its counterpart in America.
- Removed US forces, however the US still continues to sell weapons to Taiwan, not accepted the original proposal, only agreed to this so that normalization can go on.
- "Acknowledge" : acknowledging a fact vs acknowledging its legitimacy.

Normalization debate : US presidents often say that they will strengthen the US's position in the US China relationship as their candidacy promises. However, when they are elected they usually back away when they find out the cost of what they were about to do.

Taiwan Relations Act:
- Use of force : a great concern for China. **Concern** implies that nothing would really be done by China if this happens but they will be really upset.
- Sell limited quantities of weapons to Taiwan such that it can defend itself, how? Taiwan is small. Too hard to get it to be able to defend against China that is a giant.
