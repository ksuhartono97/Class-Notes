# The Imperial and Republican Eras (7 February 2017)

Trump is ignoring the Xi Jinping(the president of China), haven't talked since inauguration.

Alternative facts: **Facts** that are contradictory, but are nevertheless still facts. They take a great deal to judge and produce very complicated patterns.

Example: Trump ignoring president of China, but his daughter and granddaughter went for an event from the Chinese embassy for Chinese New Year celebration.

Finance headquarters mostly in Boston.

Family offices: an office that manages the financial needs of a family.

Boston Tea Party, tea imported from China, this tea is later thrown into the water by a group called "Patriots" that was angry due to high import taxes for tea.

Thomas Jefferson:

- Religious : cut out a KJV bible, removed pages that he thought were too superstitious, creating the Jefferson bible.
- Influenced by Chinese architecture, thus his buildings are similar to Chinese buildings. Example of this: in a house designed by him, the lower floors have shorter door frames and higher floors have taller door frames. Due to the lower floors being intended for use by slaves, whereas the masters live on the upper floors.

Guangzhou, the only city from which trade by China with the outside world can occur. This fact caused outer cities like Taiwan and Hong Kong to emerge, to ease trade with China.

The Opium War: The Chinese tried to restrict import of Opium into China, China lost this war due to the British being technologically more advanced. The Brits were importing opium due to the high value it fetched and the profit that it created for them.

The Treaty of Wangxia: allowed the US to get the benefits of any other countries that has agreements with China.

US is an inspiration to many Chinese intellectuals seeking to improve their country. The US is seen as a source of information and power.

US was eager to support the modernization of China, because:

- To be friendly with China
- To convert China to Christianity
- Economic reasons
- Strategic advantage

US wants to make China look similar to US (statement by governor of Kansas City, the epitome of US cities at the time)

US Chinese exclusion act, many Chinese were not allowed to enter the US.

> History doesn't repeat itself. However there are recurring patterns.
