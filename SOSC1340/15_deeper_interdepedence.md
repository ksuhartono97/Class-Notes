# Deeper Interdependence

China seeking investment opportunities abroad : can do because they have amassed money. Why do they want t do it? Because it generates great profit.

Chinese investment in US growing faster than US investment in China.

- Desire to borrow US brands to sell Chinese products. They sometimes try to acquire foreign companies (and their brands) through investment.
- Acquiring a site to do production / manufacture (the desire to)
- Desire to move some assets offshore : US as a "safe haven" for assets.

China's investment in US is rapidly growing, but the total amount is still smaller than other countries like France.

## Problems Faced by Foreign Investment in China

Idea that "investment is the answer" has its drawbacks too

> Some terminologies, direct investment involves ownership or creation of a new asset. Indirect investment involves acquiring assets that already exist.

- Argument that China wants foreign firms but it also wants to promote Chinese companies, creates concern because seemingly the long term strategy of China is to squeeze the foreign companies out. Amplified by increase in China's capability to compete with foreign investors
- Chinese firms using economic sanctions to advance foreign policy objectives
- Perceptions that China is trying to extract skilled workers and technology for their own use.

## Problems with China outbound investment

China has been criticized for some investments in Africa due to being "exploitative".

- Few local workers, use of large number of Chinese workers
- Remit earnings back to China (politically sensitive)
- Projects that are not commercially viable, only do the projects to acquire resources and export back to China.

Done to developing countries. US is not a developing country, so this created a lot of problems.

## What could go wrong with China's investments in the US

CFIUS blocking projects in advanced technologies and critical infrastructure (anything that is essential to a functioning economy). Controversial issue in both countries, China can feel discriminated.

Example projects that were blocked(reviewed) :

- Acquisition of the Hotel of Historia : hotel where US presidents stay, issue that the new owner of the hotel would tap the rooms. Approved.
- Acquisition of an American Oil Company : China withdrew bid

> Great suspicion on both sides.

May cause resentment : Chinese workers and managers imported instead of US workers.

> Refer to sunflower movement in Taiwan, when there was resentment of the use of Chinese workers instead of Taiwanese workers.

Mistrust can cause change in perception.
