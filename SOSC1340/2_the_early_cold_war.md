# The Early Cold War (9 February 2017)

Chinese revolution triggered by Chinese exclusion act (see lecture 1). Caused a very strong anti-American movement. The Chinese boycotted American products, no purchase of American goods. This boycott lasted a short time, but was very effective.

Communism challenged American Western Democracy, to some extent even its religious aspect.

World War 2 = Pacific War = Anti Japanese War

This war made US & China allies to fight Japan. As US becomes aware of possible benefits of cooperation, the US attempted to form a coalition government with the communists (China). Several of the attempts:

- Dixie mission: definition of Dixie itself are the southern states that rebelled against the North in the US Civil War (called Dixie states). Thus the mission is to go to Dixie states in China so that the two sides will coordinate military efforts and aid US in the war against Japan
- Hurley Mission: bring together more formally the nationalists and communists to make a coalition government. Americans wanted this government to calm the revolution and create a cooperative coalition.
- Marshall Mission : attempt to renegotiate some kind of coalition government, failed.

US associated itself with the nationalists in China, because it was the force that was not similar to the new rising power, the Soviets (communists).

> Result: by 1949, the nationalists lost and the communists won. However there are uncertainties.

> - What would be the position of the communists and Mao Zedong. Mao had bad relations with Moscow, due to bad advice that is often given by the Soviets. However they need assistance from the Soviets.

"Let the dust settle" : let the Soviets and China fight first because they will have bad relations. Let the civil war finish itself. Never happened, too hard for the communists to attack Taiwan, where the nationalists are hiding.

Don't confuse prediction with preference. This caused prosecution in the US of people who predicted Communism would win in China.

Korean War caused US and China to be in bloody war, even though the final result was a draw (no clear winner, both sides won and lost equally)

**Liberation**: US tried to liberate China from communism. Parallel to liberating North Korea.

**Containment**: Political and military capability to prevent communist insurgencies from using military forces to come into power. Done by signing military treaties and security treaties with countries other than China. Important treaties:

- With Japan
- With South Korean

These treaties do not oblige the US to do anything. Only one treaty did, even then it existed only to prevent the domino effect of country after country falling to communism power.

**Isolation** : avoid all diplomatic relations with China.

Chinese communists tried to block treaty between US and Taiwan by attacking outer islands important to Taiwan, result : it forced US to believe that it is imperative to make a treaty. Which is the total opposite of the effect that they wanted to achieve.

**Challenge to US policies** : because China started to modernize itself and stated reaching out. Causing US allies to defect from the isolation pact and established contact with China. Example: France and UK (due to Hong Kong being one of their colonies)

Result, the US changed their policy to containment without isolation.
