# Hedging, Balancing

Rise of tougher visions : China as US's strategic competitor instead of partner. George W. Bush said that China is going to be a competitor, and that he was going to upgrade relations with Taiwan.

> A common action : unhappy with China, then US will push relations with Taiwan (a link that is found)

Doing all it takes : doing all it takes to help defend Taiwan, due to fear of war with China for Taiwan's ends.

> China as a strategic competitor is a tougher and more realistic view on the relationship.

EP3 incident, April 2001 (soon after Bush Administration came) : the EP3 is a plane that was used to monitor China's military preparation. China's plane got too close and rammed the plane.

This incident made bush have to back off on his view that China is a strategic competitor. And further attempted to reverse the damage, China is a strategic competitor but economic partner.

Calls on both countries to be "responsible stakeholders" as attempts to steer away from the "strategic competitor" view. As they failed, they are replaced by tougher postures.

## Hedging

A financial term, a backup plan to cushion you just in case main plan failed. Driven by the idea that attempts to build a cooperative relationship may fail and what to do if everything failed, need to "hedge" agains China's uncertain intentions.

"Shaping" : hope that China would make the right strategic choices. But they would have a "hedge" as an insurance policy against the negative outcomes.

"Peer competitor" implies that the competition is as strong as you. China was trying to match US which is a great concern for US.

Diplomatic component, need for a diplomatic strategy on shaping China's behaviour.

Military component, air-sea battle concept (renamed to soften the tone) later modified to include land. This is a very threatening thing to China.

## Pivoting

A pivot to Asia, redeploy US priorities (military) to Asia. Due to the view that US was disengaging from Asia when Asia wants US in the region.

Meaning of pivoting : a "whole of government approach", cannot be the responsibility of the ministry, department, or agency. Need everyone to contribute.

Multi functional approach : a very broad strategy.

> Term was problematic, had to be replaced by rebalancing (still not the most appropriate, raised a different suspicion). The pivoting term had suggested neglect from Middle East.

Official view on rebalancing : still hoping for a cooperative relationship with China. An even-handed strategy, fix relations with China and reinforce position in Asia.
