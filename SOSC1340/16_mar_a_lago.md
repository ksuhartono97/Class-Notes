# The "Mar-A-Lago Summit"

Productive summits : trip driven diplomacy. Creates useless arguments due to being too detailed that they are useless in the larger scale of things (too minor to be useful).

Mar A Lago Summit didn't fall to any of the four categories of summits.
- Good as a get to know you summit.
- Attack on Syria was a distraction, not really botched summit
- Above all is a stabilizing summit
  - Relieved uncertainty due to previous comments, caused uncertainty to be reduced.
  - Neither leader raised issues about Taiwan/human rights. Might have contributed to the stableness of the summit.
  - Discussions were friendly : good chemistry.

3 Key deliverables:
- Accelerated 100 day discussion of trade issues : this is a very fast pace compared to other previous discussions.
- Dialogue between military chiefs of staff : the people who usually run the military of the country in US and China.

## Comprehensive Dialogue
Comprehensive dialogue will replace the strategic and economic dialogue due to its disappointing results.

# Possible Content of the Security and Diplomacy Track
Conventional security : issues that could give rise to the threat or use of force.

Cooperative security : issues that could be managed through cooperation.

Human security : threats to well-being of individual citizens. Compare to national security : involves moving armies around to maintain nation state's security
