# The Challenge of the Thucydides Trap
Poll results in US: young people seeing China as good, elders not liking China. There is a worry whether this is a generation problem? As they get older, their view will shift to more conservative.

Poll results in China: may be questionable in integrity, reluctant to express honest opinion. Showed worse views of US citizens.

US and China both tried hard to not become rivals, to have a good relationship, but they failed. A lot of competition in the relationship.

Executive order from Clinton (Bill Clinton) : avoided legislative law that would require him to fulfill the threat. To also avoid extra requirements for renewal of MFN status.

## Reemergence of the Taiwan Issue
New PRC president Lee Teng-Hui that focused on Taiwan. Lee Teng-Hui disguised the fact that he isn't an everyday Kuomintang official. He studied in Japan, spoke Japanese, is a Christian (due to study in the US) and identified himself as a Japanese. And he was actually able to move things forward with China.

1952 Consensus : Each side is committed to "One China" policy. Common commitment to the unification of China.

He tried to expand Taiwan's democratic relationship, he finds it unacceptable that countries were cutting communications with China because they recognized PRC.

"Trust diplomacy" used: Diplomacy that doesn't mention its actual target, only pretends to do something, e.g. vacation (unofficial relationship).

Decision on Lee Deng Hui's visa was given by the US in the end, to allow him. Because when press and cons were weighed. The con was only China not liking it, and the president felt that China had done a lot of things that they didn't like.

Lee made a political speech in Cornell even though he promised and assured the US that he won't say anything political.

China's response to Lee's US visit : very very angrily. US is a disappointing ally.

Missile firing : similar to artillery blockade. Threaten to block shipping if the Taiwanese people elected Lee Deng Hui again. Even though he actually won again in the 1996 election. (Missile firing in 1995 and didn't work)

Why did China react so strongly?
- Always had mistrust of Lee-Deng Hui: starting to show his true colors. People in Beijing won't let the trends go any further.
- Resentment of perceived American backsliding: angry of the US at their failure.

American's response : dispatched on aircraft carrier group off Taiwan. To maintain Taiwan Relations Act : to help Taiwan maintain its security if they are coerced by China using a show of force.# Thucydides Trap

The risk of armed conflict between a rising power and the dominant power.

The Pelopponesian wars: War between Sparta (established) and Athens (rising).

> "What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta (Thucydides)"

It will trap them in a hostile relationship. Conflict is inevitable.

Could the Thucydides trap be avoided?
- Both sides tried to prevent this from happening
- How was war between US and British avoided? Common values & common interests that eased the worries.
