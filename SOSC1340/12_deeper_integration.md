# Deeper Integration and Engagement through "Strategic Dialogue"
Frustrating gabfests(slang for random talk) : Festival of empty talk

WTO failed : trade problem is not a real problem. Imbalance of trade was a result of imbalance in the domestic company. Implies that the result would happen in trade with everyone, not just China.

Major Components of GNP:
- I : investment
- C : consumption, when you buy stuff
- G : government spending, who is doing the spending
- X : exports, sell what you produce overseas (net export what we sell - what we import(M))
- T : taxes
- S : savings

Behavioral and Political economics : need to solve internal imbalances to solve external imbalances, cannot let internal imbalance continue because external imbalance is unsustainable.

## Strategic Economic Dialogue
- Appears again : indicates that they will focus on fundamental and long term goals instead of immediate issues
- A problem : only dealt with economics. Thus was renamed, strategic and economic dialogue. So that they can deal with strategic and economic issues.

"Incomplete success", basically means it failed.
- Failed to create binding decisions (which is the goal of this dialogue)
- Isn't popular in the US. Actually more success in China, brought people from different departments together.

Problem was identified, solution was identified but the solution was not easy to implement.

## The G-2
Never actually adopted by either US or China. But influenced the start of discussions for G-7 (with other advanced countries), G-8 (added Russia), and eventually G-20(added emerging economies).

Proposed by Fred Bergsten : attracted a lot of attention though never really adopted. Showed how people outside the government would change government decisions.

Devaluation of currency to fix economic crisis:
- Boost import by devaluing (lower value of currency)
- Decrease export by increasing value of currency

G-2 didn't work because it was not popular / supported by popular view.
- Too few, only 2 countries. Other countries don't want to let US and China to decide decisions internationally. Cannot single them out, not to mention US and China's differences. Could cause problems in achieving distribution of power.
- Its failure actually fuelled G20's success

## Co-management
Far more discussed in China than US (unlike G2 that was discussed in both countries). To be succesfull, needs a powerful superordinate goal (overwhelming goal : a common threat or common necessary objective) and an institutionalized process (6 party talks : US, China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Taiwan) for cooperation or coordination.

However co-management failed.
- Both Taiwan and Korea wanted stability however, different interests
  - US : no war
  - China : North Korea must not collapse, would create a unified Korea.
- Concern from both Taiwan and South Korea : they don't want their interests to be co-managed by US and Beijing, breaks Reagan's 6 reassurances to Taiwan
