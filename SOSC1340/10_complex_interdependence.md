# Complex Interdependence

Patterns in history of US China Relations:

- Rapturous enhancement and deep disappointment cycle.
- Desire to get power and prevent power from rising in east Asia : rhymes, any power from taking over based on time.
- Strategies to prevent Thucydides trap : recurred over time, called tendencies.

> Side note: Milton Freeman, founder of monetary policy, said these strategies are recurring tides.

What are the new strategies:

- Comprehensive Engagement: hard to translate, different meaning of "engagement". America thought of stabilizing relationship after Tiananmen with dialogue and negotiations.
- Partnership: "constructive", goal is to build. Difference with engagement is that it creates a goal, create an important relationship.
- Economic interdependence (this is the new solution): Others are diplomatic, this is economic.

  - Rhymed with Nixon's saying that economic complementarity (mutual compatibility)
  - Aimed to create acceptance on rise of China's economic production power.

Theory on why interdependence:

- Realists: skeptical that this can avoid the Thucydides trap. Due to the realists view that nothing can prevent war except balance of power.
- Liberal: Democracies don't go to war with each other, solve conflict internally. "Democratic Peace" : Peace through democratization. No cause for war if everyone is in a democracy. This theory is not always true (it is a classic theory in democracy). More recent liberal views focused on economic and social interdependence. That is prevention of war due to a foreign investment, this reduces chances of war, but doesn't fully remove the possibility.

## Creating Interdependence

Was not always a fact, did not exist early on, example during embargo period. Trade barely existed, only book imports (due to belief in freedom of press)

Deng Xiaoping's policy of return and opening: gaige kaifang (1978 late), pragmatic approach, do what worked, and abandon ideologies. Allowed economic interdependence to exist.

## Constraints Remained:

### US Side:

- MFN annual renewal requirement: created uncertainty, scared businesses.
- Export controls on military and advanced technology.
- Review of inbound investment for security reasons. Restraints on exports and imports. To restrict China (and Japan) by subjecting goods with tariffs. A different approach to Japan: "voluntary" export restraints, telling Japan to limit exports to a certain number rather than giving tariffs. (Calculated in volume, not in price)

> Reducing numbers of items doesn't imply reducing profits.

### Chinese side:

- Restriction on inbound investment:

  - Technology transfer requirement: need to give an advanced technology to be able to invest.
  - Expert requirements: if you want to invest, you have to create an export complensation for us (reciprocity)
  - Restrictions on forms of ownership

- Excluded sectors: no trade/investments on certain sectors.
- Import-substitution strategy & foreign exchange controls:buy at home" strategy

Constraints are being relaxed overtime::

- Clinton administration's decision to delink MFN status renewal from human rights concerns, allowed renewal to be guaranteed granting stability for businesses.
- Increased opportunities for direct investments

> Trend of relaxing constraints (they are still in place, not fully removed)

Socio - Economic Ties are being facilitated:

- Educational programs to train students, to provide technical assistance
- Supported assistance by major international institutions, World Bank, IMF. Example: lifting sanctions on getting loans from world bank.

## "Complex Relationship"

Not just trade/simple exchange of commodities. Trade flows:

- Investment flows
- Student exchanges
- Individual and commercial tourism: adoptions, interracial marriages.

China came to depend on US for key aspects of its economic development strategies.

- Move the labor pool that is untapped in an agriculture environment, requirements to do this:

  - Market: US is one of the biggest and open Market
  - Collaboration with US multi national corporations : provides machinery, managers, design, brands, etc.

- US also depend on China to finance American consumption:

  - Wages were growing stagnant : solution, both parents work (women working)
  - American dollars recycled by China to buy American debt

Economic Interdependent Relations is Imbalanced

- US ran large and growing trade deficits while China ran surplus
- Not only bilateral imbalance, relation with global economy and internal economy caused imbalance in the world.

> US consumed too much relative to its savings, caused them to have a lot of foreign debt, whereas China consumed too little.

"Win - win" relationship : but was actually unacceptable, too much imbalance.
