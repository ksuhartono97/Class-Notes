# Reassurance and Reducing Mistrust

Security is the most important concern in international politics. Cannot rely on economics (secondary to security) to solve security issues.

Trust : confidence that other party will not harm your interests

Confidence in capability that people can have good intentions but they do not have the capability to fulfill this intention (over promise)

Mistrust : doubt in honesty, capability, and intention. Either one or all of them. Caused by :

- A lack of "trustiness" : the willingness to trust
- A lack of "trustworthiness" : implies trust must be earned, some people are more trustworthy.

Why does it matter? The world is a transactional world, there is no need for trust

- Confirmation bias : tend to seek facts to confirm what you believe, affects perception negativity
- Reduces prospects for agreements, the view that the agreement is risky (idea of relative gain)

## How can trust be restored?

Problem, loss of trust is a devastating phenomenon, very hard to restore.

Methods :

- Providing benefit and assistance : if one side sees the other acting in its own interests, may not provide gratitude or trust
- Promoting personal relationships :

  - US : desire for an intimate relationship with another partner. Clinton had such a relationship, Obama was less successful, basically because different personalities.
  - Might not work : can't choose counterpart : harder to predict chemistry, also constrained by environment, personal relationship may be limited.

- Increased transparency : more of an American idea

  - US likes intimate relationships, China likes more of a working relationship.
  - Doesn't always work because of its differences with China's personality

Doesn't really work : US feels that China isn't that open. China feels US is intimidating them, trying to control.

- Reassurance : the idea that we need to find other side's concern and reassure them that what they fear is unrealistic or reassure that it won't happen.

  - Reassurance is always followed by resolve, but maybe contradictory with each other. Chinese approach : assured that China can't and won't push US out of Asia nor try to replace US as a dominant power.
  - Failed because of mixed messages that blurs the reassurance message : implied that this reassurance is temporary, bide time until we are stronger.
  - American Response : initially positive, but became negative over time (due to security concerns). "Blank check" quality of respecting core interests : China's core interests keep on changing, the amount can be changed.

Strategies that haven't been tried :

- Create bargains : mutual accomodation

  - Grand bargain :if China stops trying to reduce American influence in the world, America would stop trying to influence Asia. Very hard to achieve

- Leaders of both countries need to educate the public of the importance of the US China relationship

  - US public is not prepared for the rise of China. Belief that they can still maintain US dominance.
  - Chinese public opinion : "post humiliation" world, need to stop looking for actions that seem to not be paying respect.
