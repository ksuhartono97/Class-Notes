# Integrating China as a Responsible Stakeholder

Order:

- International institutions and organizations : like UN, formal.
- Regimes: less formal, tend to come in rules and norms.

Rules based on international order : mostly created by US, form international organizations to prevent further World Wars. Solution : follow rules to resolve differences (created by organizations like UN).

"World Government" : moderate behaviour and prevent conflict through a central system.

Different from earlier approaches, which are bilateral diplomatic negotiations. This didn't achieve successful results, example in security and trade.

International method: Present US interests as international standards. Interesting for China, who is trying to integrate to international economy (willing to comply), giving China status in the world.

Institutional Liberalism : make institutions that people will follow because it is in their interests. Create an international order that can be followed : makes the world less anarchic.

## Areas of Integration

- Security : motivated by fear of war, pressure on China to join a variety of arms control regimes. :

  - Non-proliferation treaty: fairly easy for China to do, because already have nukes.
  - Chemical weapons convention
  - Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty : signed but not ratified (not approved by the legislation), signing only is less formal.
  - Missile Technology Control Regime: signed but wasn't allowed to join the organization. A group that regulates components regarding missiles.

- International convent on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights : China likes agreements like this, signed and ratified
- International convent on civil and political rights : China signed but not ratified, less agreeable for them
- International Criminal Court : neither US or China has ratified. Allows an organization to convict world leaders due to gross violations of human Rights

WTO : forces China to :

- Agree to principles of free trade
- Relax certain tariff(tax) and non-tariff barriers
- Accept status as non-market economy : afraid of China selling products at a lower price than what they should be (underpricing)

In return :

- China got permanent MFN status : PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations) and ended quotas on imports from China.

Limits to Institutional Liberalism:

- Not all signatories ratify
- Not all signatories comply : even though already signed and ratify
- Signatories can withdraw : after a year's notification, after a yer they can withdraw.
- Game the system : seek loopholes and interpreting commitments to serve their interests
