# Abstract Class and Interface
Putting an `abstract` keyword will make the class into an abstract class. Note, put the `abstract` before `class`. So an example declaration is `public abstract class`.

Also applicable to methods, an abstract method means that it has an `abstract` keyword and the method doesn't have to be implemented (empty body). In the UML, abstract methods are *italicized*.
