#Non-Obviousness
Must be non-obvious to someone skilled in related fields to pass this test.

Was once used by court to deny most patents, but then they realized this is
too harsh as a patent shouldn't require a brilliant act of new genius.

Not case law based, completely based on opinions of industry experts.

Has to represent advance over any form of prior art.

Statutory test of nonobviousness:
1. Survey of scope and content of prior art: We have to conduct a thorough
survey of every form of previous art to what you are patenting.
2. Examination of differences between invention and prior art
3. Determination of the level of ordinary skill in the art might measure
obviousness

In light of this 3 stage process, the court or the patent office can then
determine if the proposed innovation exhibits nonobviousness

Duty of candor: duty of telling the truth about known prior arts.


#The Patenting Process
3 step-process in filling for patents in the USA (and in many countries):
- File a provisional **intention** to file patent form: Usually used to
avoid the statutory bar on applying to patent, as this gives you an extra one year to file
the actual patent application. However the day you submit this provisional patent, it
is considered as the starting date of your patent.
- File a formal patent application: All the details of the patent application, might take around 6 months
- Navigate the Patent Review and Appeal Process: may happen again and
again before patent is granted, a lot of legal costs also. May take more than
a year to compelete. Frequently, patents are rejected here, but you can always appeal.
Usually you appeal first to the patent officer's supervisor.

Submitting a provisional intention can be skipped. Also the patent's application
can be modified if you only submitted the provisional one, if you have
submitted the formal one, the only way to modify it is if parts of your attempt
was a subject of concern for the patent officer. 

###Appealing Process
Usually the court will reject your patent, then based on the objections
that they raised, you can respond to it, revise your patent request, and try
to resolve it with the officer. *If* you fail to resolve it, you can appeal
to the supervisor which will then check your patent request. If it still fails
you can attempt to appeal to court.

>Supervisors generally will be more inclined to agree to the decision of their employee,
>however they will also have their own considerations as they will not
>want to look bad in court, or get sued because of the decision they made to grant the patent.

###After patent is issued
You can sue people now. Important notes:
- Notification of patent (the patent pending mark), to protect some legal damages right. People will notice
you are getting a patent so maybe they won't attempt to copy your product
- Patent infringement is only a civil offense, not a criminal offense, so you can only 
remedy it with a civil lawsuit.
- As it is not a criminal offense, both the police or the government won't help you

Patent lawsuits are expensive and risky.

The US lawsuit system on patents is encouraging the action of suing people over patent infringement.

###Costs to get a US patent:
- Filing the provisional patent application:
    - often done early to discourage competition
    - cheap to do
    - short application, minimal info required
    - can put patent pending to product after applying for this
- File the formal patent application:
    - Takes a lot of time and technical inputs
    - Significant costs involved (~US$100k)
- Navigate the patent review and appeal process:
    - Most of the costs are going to be from here
    - Most likely need an attorney here
    - Costs of patent process can exceed US$ 1 million
    
###Prior Discussion for Utility Patents
3 types of patents which can be granted under US laws:
- Utility patents: what we have been talking about since beginning of class
- Design Patents (much less common historically:
    - Protects any novel, original (rather than nonobvious), and ornamental
    (rather than useful) design for an article of manufacture. Eg: Apple
    can get a design on the Apple logo, the one where the apple has been bitten.
    - This type of patent is similar to a copyright.
    - Has a shorter duration, 14 yeas long
- Plant patents: for asexually reproduced plants only. Means that the plants are
man-made, and cannot be found in nature growing by itself.

#Midterm material
##Video on fair use, Tales of Disney
The content of this video wil be used as a material. 

>Title of vid: A Fair(y) Use Tale

Nature of work is not commercial. It was not intended to get money in any form. It is also entertainment
but its contents are based on factual details. It's actual intent was education.

This work doesn't cause Disney to lose any money. It won't make audiences
not want to watch Disney movies. It even might have some positive impact actually.

But the best defense against copyright infringement in this case is that
it was a work of parody.
