# Patent Process Issues and Challenges

Any French derived legal system are more likely to only look at **statutory law**.

But in any British derived legal system (any country which was once a British colony). It is likely that they will observe both **statutory law** and **common law**.

Courts can look at the decisions of a higher court, such as the Supreme Court, to help them with the decision. However, that higher court decision has no actual influence on the decision, i.e. the court can choose freely whether to follow or not follow the decision.

In the USA, different states has different laws.

Example: California, law system based on Spanish law system because they were a Spanish colony before the USA conquered them.

## USA law structure:

Federal law overrides / over-rules state-law if supreme court agrees/allows federal supremacy

Examples of federal laws:

- Customs (Import and Export)
- Tax (Federal)
- Patents/copyrights
- Military

> State court has no authority on copyright and patents, so if you have any issue with copyrights and patents, you **have** to go to federal court. However state law has authority over trademarks.

Within court, there are two types of laws:

- Civil law : other people are suing you, a crime against someone else. A party suing another party.

  - Contract
  - Tort : There is a kind of harm (can be anything) that is done by one party to another party
  - Property : Consists of tangible (land, houses) and intangible property (patents, copyrights)

- Criminal law : the government or the police are suing you.

It is most common to land a civil court with problems regarding intellectual property. But it is also possible to be sued with both civil and criminal law

US Law System Hierarchy (highest to lowest) :

- US Constitution (equivalent to Basic Law in HK) : Highest authority in all matters - only way to change is an amendment, which is hard to do as it requires approval from a large number of people.
- Federal laws : specific areas allowed by US constitution. **All** patent and copyright laws are Federal Laws
- State laws : varies between states
