International issue for patents:
You have to apply for patent within one year of your first patent application
in a country. This because any prior patent is considered as prior use. So it is

It is possible to apply for an international patents, so that you can just check a list
of countries you want to apply to and then just go through one process of validating your patent
to get a patent in all the countries. Does not apply in the US as the US doesn't want to share
their patent verification process.

Trademark is the most not international IP law.
