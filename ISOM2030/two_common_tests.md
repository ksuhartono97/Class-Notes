# Two Common Tests for Trademark Infringement

## Trademark violation: The Frisch Test:

- Strength of the mark: how recognizable your product is
- Relatedness of the goods : how closely can you relate to the product itself in your field of work
- Similarity of the Marks : Whether or not there is an actual similarity between your logo and the infringing company's logo
- Evidence of the actual confusion
- Marketing channels used : wholesale or non wholesale, global or local
- Likely degree of purchaser care : how much will a customer pay attention to a product. Inexpensive products means that customers most likely won't have a lot of care.
- Defendant's intent in selecting the mark : the use of the mark makes the original company have a harder time in expanding into the market.
- Likelihood of Expansion of Product lines : will the violating side be likely to expanding their product lines.

These points do not have the same degree of importance. Their importance is considered by the judge, according to the judge.

Example on ferrari vs roberts : winner ferrari.

## Trademark violation : The Polaroid Test

- Strength of the Mark : tendency to identify goods as coming from a specific supplier or how well people identify that mark.
- Similarity of the marks
- Proximity of the products : how close are they in nature of the goods or in the marketing channels. Similar to marketing channels used and relatedness of the goods points in the Frisch test
- Bridging the gap : similar to likelihood of expansion in the Frisch test. Means protecting the "senior user's interest in being able to enter a related market"
- Evidence of actual confusion
- Good faith in adopting the mark : did the junior user in the market intend to make something or not. Similar to defendant's intent in selecting the mark, only in the Frisch test, it is more generic.
- Quality of the respective goods
- Sophistication of buyers

## Protecting Trade Secrets & Computer Crimes

Trade secret can be anything that is used in your business that gives you an advantage over a competitor who doesn't know anything about it.

Secrecy must be maintained and anyone that knows the trade secret should be made aware that this is confidential company information that must not be shared.

So one of the best ways to defeat a claim of misappropriation of trade secrets is to show that the firm bringing litigation wasn't really keeping the secret diligently.

If we disclose information to the customer, and if we have the information out in the public, it is no longer protected as a trade secret.

Trade secret doesn't protect reverse engineering. Unlike patents or copyrights, even the semiconductor acts.

Hiring a former employee of a competitor company may cause you to get sued for violating trade secret laws. Be the action intentional or intentional. Because the former employee might have ideas that are trade secrets in the previous company.

Economic Espionage Act of 1996 significantly expanded trade secret protection in the US.

DMCA Criminal Liability creates criminal sanction for violation of DMCA law. But remember this is a US only law, as long as the offender never goes to any place near the US, he is fine.

Computer crimes often involve insiders. Hacking happens, but generally with inside help. More often hacking occurs by cracking through social engineering.

Hacking usually occurs due to insider help or stupidity.
