#DMCA and US Laws Impact on Global Commerce

Japan is looking to enact something similar to DMCA. Other countries
also.

###Purposes of the DMCA:
- To bring USA into compliance with international IP law
- Extend / augent US copyright law

###Areas of new laws under DMCA: 
- **"Safe harbor" for ISPs**: for internet service providers, such as Google, Yahoo, etc. This
basically allows them to keep materials for their use. For example, news articles can be seen
and read in the US. But this is only available in the US. Other countries do not have this. As
such, countries like Germany has sued Google for cases like this. Causing Google to remove said 
content.
- **Protection of Digital Rights Management**: limitations on number
of copies allowed. An example of this: laptops has disk drives that
is equipped with DRM software that allows region switching. So say previous disk
was a region 3 disk and then the next disk you put in is a region
1 disk. The DRM software can switch the disk's region for you. However
there is a limit to this. For this case, the limit is 3 times. 
Hence the limitations on number of copies.
- **Circumvention of Copy Protection** : getting around copy protection
is prohibited. Meaning that any DVD, music, or software, etc that has encryption,
if you remove the encryption, it is considered as a criminal offence and you can be
jailed for this. Applies even to bad encryptions.


###Application of DMCA

DMCA is a US only law, but it affects everyone on the world.
- Applies to any business in the USA, you can be fined in the US. Even if it is you are only an employee, you 
can also be fined for it.
- Apply to any individual in the USA (even on temporary travel) for acts done outside the USA.

>The moment you enter US land, you are instantly subject to US law.

Effects of this:
- Loss of US Market Sales, especially for software due to how easy it is
to break the encryption on a software. Example: decryption software for cracking games,
the DMCA ensures that anyone making or selling such software can make be sued for a great amount
of money.
- Costs / risk of creation of software increase. (for software types mentioned
above)

You can get arrested for breaking any US law outside of the US at any point of time if you enter
the US.

Academic researchers are giving up on decryption researches, because:
 - You most likely can't publish the journal anywhere.
 - Risk of criminal sanctions
 - Difficulty of any future commercialization
 
There still exists encryption breaking research, however it is very limited.

###Objections to the DMCA in USA: 
- Restricts free speech (which is protected under First Amendment) : for example, what if you write
some code that can actually hack something. However it wasn't meant to be used for hacking. It was simply for
communicating in code with other programmers, to talk about a concept that is hard to explain
with ordinary English
- Restricts innovation and research
- Criminalizes relatively "innocent" behaviour: for example, ripping disks for location shifting and time shifting
- Eliminates some aspects of Fair Use Defense
    - Parody and satire, cannot be used if you cannot get the file. If you break the encryption you are directly in trouble.
    Ways around it, play the disc on a monitor that passes through a recorder that records the video. Result in unencrypted 
    allowing for use.
    - Academic research or educational usage
    - Software compatibility and modifications : cannot access or modify code due to encryption.
    
###Privatization of Information:
Encryptions can be used to encrypt data which is not copyrightable, thus
creating a sort of protection for the data under DMCA.

###DMCA and Entertainment
Illegal to break any form of copy entertainment
- Copy movie to DVD
- Making a copy for iPod
- Backing up DVDs
- Illegal backups of software (which was previously expressly permitted)

These are all illegal.

###Beyond DMCA: USA Regulations
USA is the dominant hosting country for internet based businesses and sites. 
Domain names like .com, .us, .bis, .org, .gov, .edu, etc are US domains. As such
any disputes involving the legality of US domain names will be governed by US law, i.e. US 
laws apply to these disputes.

###Cyberspace Trademark Problems
Company that has a same name with another company, even though their markets don't overlap.
- If it goes online, it can take other firm's customers.

Domain names and trademark issues:
- Cyber squatting, someone in registered your company's name somewhere else. This can turn to cyber blackmail.
