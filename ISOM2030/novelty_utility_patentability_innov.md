# Novelty and Utility and Patentability and Innovation

## Novelty:

Requirement : must be **new**, in law this implies:

- Not "anticipated by Prior Art", the discovery must not already exist in some way
- If it was published more than 12 months after creation, it is not considered new anymore, law would recognise it as a public property already.

Treatment by judges on this issue maybe inconsistent, one judge may give a patent, another may not

Only the first file gets the patent, no matter who invents it. Possible solution to prevent loss of patent is to come up with an agreement, either to buy rights or to co-own the patent.

Generally:

- Any patent application must be **novel**
- Limit on public disclosure of ideas in any form is limited by the grace period. Such that before that grace period expires after your first public disclosure, you must get a patent or else it becomes public domain.
- Grace period of 12 months. (this is the absolute longest duration, exc: China - any prior publication that is not in Chinese, is not a written document. Recently updated though, so no longer an exception)

## Statutory Bar and Novelty :

- Prior to 12 months before application, any patent from anywhere in the world on your product, means that you cannot patent.
- Foreign usage and sales **not considered** : you can do these things in other countries, then go back to the US to patent.
- If patent gets published, the duration of the patent starts from the application day, not from the issue date (if it is denied though, then that request matters no more, as it is no longer considered as a previous publication even)

## Anticipation

Any prior publication or patent may result in your product not being patentable.

## Utility requirement:

- Useful
- Outside the US, the product has to have actual commercial usage (the product has been used)

Simple way and best way to show utility is with sales. As if people don't think it is useful they won't even consider buying it.

This requirement is important because patent was only designed to protect **useful** innovations.

Only some level of usefulness is required, no need to be on a very large scale.

Utility claims, e.g. from marketing and claimed benefits of a product, is not sufficient to provide legally recognized benefits. It needs to actually have statistical proof that it is doing what it is supposed to be useful for. Utility must be asserted and claimed, with support.

**Open-ended patents**: It is prohibited, the patent must have a defined purpose. Other uses may be found, but the patent protection is limited **only** to practical uses that is described in the patent application.

> Important note: non-obvious test. Whether your product's benefit is obvious or not, as the benefit for a patent needs to be non-obvious

## Illegal or Immoral Innovations

If the innovation is harmful to individuals or to society, it cannot be patented. Examples: heroin, nuclear bombs. It may be issued if there are **some** legal and beneficial usages, but perhaps not in all countries.
