# Protecting Brands and Identity & Trademark Protection and Infringement & Business Issues and Implications

## Trademark Protection

Protects the customers from getting trick, but it also protects a company's reputation.

Customers can get confused and not trusting of the quality of the product if there are a lot of fake products of that specific product. And they look very similar, causing confusion for the customers.

Basic idea behind it is to protect craftsman from having their work stolen and customers from getting tricked.

Trademark Law:

- Protects brands, corporate names or slogans
- Significant source of litigation in Cyberspace
- Can not be generic or functional, but it can be possible if the name has been around for a long time. Ex of a generic name that is trademarked: Burger King and Pizza Hut. However if it is new, it most likely cannot get protected if it has generic names.

Trademark is **very location specific**, different in every country, even in the country, it is still location specific(as in each city still differ).

There are no international agreements that forces honoring trademark laws. Unlike copyright and patents.

Trademarks **must** be registered:

- Not automatic
- Detailed and specific registration process
- Similar to the process of setting up a new company

Not absolute protection, registration priority exists, but it isn't absolute.

Gives the rights to sue people for trademark violations

You can buy trademarks from other companies. So that you can own the trademark name.

Trademark Issues:

- Usage versus intent and token usage: token usage (small scale use to get to commerce, to build up trademark)
- Distinctive, Arbitrary, Descriptive, Suggestive, Generic : nature of the words used, determines strength of trademark. Meaning that you can't really sue someone if your name or slogan is too generic. So the **stronger** your name is (the more unique it is), the more likely you are to win a trademark suit.

  - Generic names: Welcome hotel, Burger King
  - Unique names: Macintosh
  - Purposely misspell the name or word, to make it arbitrarily different, e.g. Wellcome instead of welcome.

- Foreign words - translation issues, and mistakes

  - Korean company: tried to trademark rice. Combining the english world rice and Korean word rice. So they said that Ricerice is their unique name and they tried to trademark it so that no company can use the word "Rice" in any of their products. Denied eventually.
  - Caused the trademark office to be more careful, checking possible same meanings.

- Functionality
- Secondary meaning
- Evidentiary Issues
- Disclaimers

Trademark : a mark that identifies goods. (the narrower term of trademark)

Service mark: a type of trademark for services.

Service mark is not a trademark because it is not a mark on goods in commerce. But it can also be a trademark because it is a mark on something that is being traded.

Certification mark : for something that you want to protect as a brand name.

Collective mark: used by members of an association.

Common law trademark used to be attainable only by **actual usage**. But now you can register a trademark based on _"intent to use"_.

Ghost application is not allowed, as in filing a trademark to protect something that isn't going to be used. Just to make sure nobody uses the name.

International trademarks are very weak. Only available mostly in the UK.

This international trademark weakness causes cyberspace trademark problems.

Trademark lasts forever until you lose it. There is no end to the duration of a trademark.

Reasons that might cause loss of trademark rights:

- Non-usage and abandonment

  - Non use may or may not suggest abandonment
  - US allows presumption of intent to abandon if not used for three years, if they can't prove that the trademark is being used within the three years, it can be considered that the trademark has been abandoned.

    - Something distinctive is well protected.

  - Ford Mustang example. Ford retired the mustang car brand. However, people can't take the name Mustang, because Ford is still protecting it. How? By selling Ford Mustang parts, Ford Mustang paraphernalia, clubs, etc.

- Trademark becomes generic

  - You can say the name and someone can think of something that is not associated with the product or the company. 

    - Example of this, Kleenex. If you sneeze, and then you ask for a Kleenex, you actually mean asking for a tissue. But the Kleenex name has been so well known that it loses some of their strength in the uniqueness of their trademark.

- Trademark has become deceptive

  - Can be tricky, just a name that isn't connected to the actual functionality of the product. Example company named DVD player that actually only sells devices that can only play CDs and VCDs.

Abbreviations would not be instantly protected. Have to register it.

Trademark priority : first in use.

Even though the product's trademark is already registered, can still contest by providing evidence of **actual usage** prior to the registration.

Marketing and Advertising alone may or may not be considered as actual usage. Examples that may be allowed are cars and airplanes. High end, expensive, and hard to make would imply that this trademark will actually get used.

Infringements of trademarks:

- Similarity of marks

  - Physical design, sounds, color, style : Can trademark a specific style that seems like the style of the company. Example a shoe with a red sole, that is the unique design of that company
  - Elements are interrelated and taken overall
  - Individual elements or total effect both sufficient to show that infringement has occured.
  - Homonyms of words and other similarities
  - Similar sounds with different meanings -Styleomatic (the style of saying it) vs Dialomatic (the way it sounds in a dialog(?))

- Similarity of Goods or Services : example of this, a dentist called McDental.

  ```
  Their logo has the same M design that McDonalds has, they even have a play
                                  area for children, akin to what McDonalds has. McDonalds say that this might
                                  confuse customers. Why do they say this? Because, the dentist specializes in taking care of children.
                                  So if the kid sees a big M, their initial presumption is that, this place is where
                                  I can get food. But if they actually go in and has a traumatic experience with
                                  the dentist, they might associate a fear with the big M. As such scaring the kid
                                  from ever going to McDonalds because they associated fear with it due to McDental.
  ```

- Character and similarity of the market

  - Based on consumer and context analysis : people may not be paying attention to what they are buying if it is trivial. Example, bottled water
  - Purchaser of car less likely to be confused : less likely because if we buy a car (something expensive), will have done checking first.
  - Channels of trade important consideration

    - Wholesale product not same as retail product
    - Furniture made for trade not same as retail
