#Protecting Brands and Identity & Trademark Protection and Infringement & Business Issues and Implications

##Trademark Protection
Protects the customers from getting trick, but it also protects
a company's reputation.

Customers can get confused and not trusting of the quality of the product
if there are a lot of fake products of that specific product. And they look
very similar, causing confusion for the customers.

Basic idea behind it is to protect craftsman from having their work stolen
and customers from getting tricked.

Trademark Law:
- Protects brands, corporate names or slogans
- Significant source of litigation in Cyberspace
- Can not be generic or functional, but it can be possible if the
name has been around for a long time. Ex of a generic name that is 
trademarked: Burger King and Pizza Hut. However if it is new, it
most likely cannot get protected if it has generic names.

Trademark is **very location specific**, different in every country, 
even in the country, it is still location specific(as in each city still
differ). 

There are no international agreements that forces honoring trademark laws. Unlike
copyright and patents.

Trademarks **must** be registered:
- Not automatic
- Detailed and specific registration process
- Similar to the process of setting up a new company

Not absolute protection, registration priority exists, but it
isn't absolute.

Gives the rights to sue people for trademark violations

You can buy trademarks from other companies. So that you can own the
trademark name.

Trademark Issues:
- Usage versus intent and token usage: token usage (small scale use to get to
commerce, to build up trademark)
