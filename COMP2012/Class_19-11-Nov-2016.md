#Continuing on STL

###Continuing on algorithms

Function pointers:
```cpp
double func(int a, char b) {
...
}

//The function pointer
double (*haha) (int, char);
haha = func; //make it point to the function func

//Using the function pointer
haha(1, 'a');
```

You can declare a function pointer template that can point
to any function type. As long as the parameter list is still the same.

```cpp
T (*) (const T&, const T&);
```

>Review: `void*` can accept any datatype. Very powerful type of a pointer. Used to make something generic.

An array of function pointers:
```cpp
double *(f[]) (double x, double y) = {add, subtract, multiply, divide};
//Syntax for it, assuming we already have the four functions declared elsewhere.
```

`static_cast` : the C++ style type casting.

Example:
```cpp
int i_compare(const void* i, const void* j) {
    return *(static_cast<const int*>(i)) - * static_cast<const int*>(j));
}
// To cast the void to an int datatype.
```

`sizeof` gets the number of bytes occupied by something.

Example:
```cpp
int data[] = {3, 7, 5, 1, 9};
int num_data = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);
//Get the size of the array using sizes.
```

**Important**: Why do we have to cast a `void*` to a certain datatype?

Because we **cannot** dereference a `void*`. So if we want to dereference it, we have to cast it to a type first.

`qsort` can be used to sort any datatype, even user defined datatypes(objects). Thus, the reason
why we need to pass in the compare function is so that we can help the `qsort` function
have a form of way to compare datatypes.

####Function objects
`operator()` if we allow an object to support this operator, it means that the object is a function object. A function object
means that we can actually call a function with the object.

A usage of the function object is to replace the function pointer. As the function
pointer is a C concept. So if we want to replace the function pointer with something
that does more or less the same thing in C++ (in OOP), we can use the function
object.

Other names of a function object: functoid or functor.

#Namespace
The idea of namespace is that we use the `namespace` keyword to define
regions in the program. Such that if there are same function names, the compiler
won't complain.


`using` declaration is used to denote what you want to use for something

Example:
```cpp
using apple::Some_Class; //Any Some_Class in my program refers to the Some_Class in apple
using apple::Stack; //Any Stack in my program is the one in apple
using ms::Other_Class;
using ms::func;

int main() {
    Some_Class sc;
    Other_class oc;
    Stack apple_stack;
    ms::Stack ms_stack; //Still can manually force it to use a certain namespace    

    int i  = func(2);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Problem with namespaces: ambiguity

Can bring all namespaces into the program at once, but you must ensure that there is no ambiguities.

```cpp
...

namespace ms = microsoft;
using namespace apple;
using namespace ms;

int main() {
    Some_Class sc;
    Other_Class oc;
    
    Stack S;    //Error : ambiguous, same name exists in both namespaces
    ms::Stack ms_stack;     // OK
    apple::Stack apple_stack;   //OK
    
    return 0;
}
```
