##Function Templates

```cpp
template <typename T>
T my_max(const T& a,  const T& b)
{
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

//What C++ does
//int my_max(const int& a,  const int& b)
//{
//    return (a > b) ? a : b;
//}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int c = my_max (a,b);
    double d = 20.1;
    double e = 30.87;
    double f = my_max(d,e);
    int g = 20;
    double h = my_max(my_max(d, e), g);
    //C++ will generate a new one that supports (double, int)
    //No type coercion
    //However, this is gonna be an error, as they do not know which one is the return type
}
```

Function templates can be used to define a function that can have
multiple dataypes. In the example above, C++ will be able to substitute
the type T with integer, because we passed an integer argument
Same case applies for the double one.


>Function template main usage: You can define one template for a function that can support many data types

Syntax:
```cpp
template <typename T> //Can also be written as template <class T>
T funcname (args) { ... }

//The class one is old definition, it is changed to typename to avoid confusion
```
This process of creating a template is called **template instantiation**

Based on problem earlier, if we do `double h = my_max(double a, int b)`
it will be an error, because C++ doesn't know which one to return.

Thus, you need explicit template instantiation to tell C++ which datatype
to take for the return type of the function.

```cpp
...
int main () {
    int a  = 10;
    double b = 20.1;
    double c = my_max<double>(a, b);
    //Explicitly tell C++ that my_max here will return double
    //So that C++ doesn't get confused.
}
```

Another solution:
```cpp
template <typename T1, typename T2>
T1 my_max( const T1 &a, const T2& b)
{
    return (a>b) ? a : b;
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    double b = 20.1;
    double c = my_max(a, b);
}
```
This solution will force the return type of the function to be the same
as T1. Therefore in this case, it will always return an `int` type.

Drawback: It will force return an int, therefore it will do type conversion

Solution : `my_max (b, a)` then it shall be fine. However this is a bad code implementation

We could also explicitly tell the code what are the datatypes of the 
`T`. By doing `my_max<int, double>`. However this should be unnecessary as C++ can
already infer the datatype from the arguments.

>Important, to determine the datatype of T, the function needs to have **parameters**, without it function template won't work

##Class Templates
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Haha {
    private:
        T* arr;
    public:
        Haha() {arr = new T[100];}
        ~Haha() {delete [] arr;}
};

int main () {
    Haha<int> Hello; 
    Haha<Teacher> Hi;
}
```

Class templates realized datatypes by getting it specifically from the 
code with the `<>` operator. Or explicitly telling it.

If you want to use a class template, in another class, you would have to
explicitly tell the other class that the other one is a template

##Operator Overloading

```cpp
class A {
    public:
        A() {...}
}

int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    int c = a + b; //int c = operator+(a,b);
    // C++ will convert it
    int d  = a - b; //int d = operator-(a,b);
    
    A obj1, obj2;
    A obj3 = obj1 + obj2; //A obj3 = operator+(obj1, obj2);
    //By default this is impossible as C++ doesn't know what to do for this
    //You can however define a specific function that accepts the operation.
}

//So, this should be added at the top,
A operator+(const A&x, const A&y) {...}
//This is a direct example of an operator overloading
//This is a global operator overloading

//It could also be done as a member function, so if we have
//defined a member function that does operator
//e.g: int c = a.operator+(b);
```

Operators in C++ are actually **functions** !!

```cpp
ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const A& x) {
    ...
    return os;
}
//cout is a predefined object in c++ and its type is ostream

cout<<obj3 <<endl; //operator<<(cout, obj3);
```
You have to return the object, so that you can do operator chaining
