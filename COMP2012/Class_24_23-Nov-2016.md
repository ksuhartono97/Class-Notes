# Continuing on Abstract Data Types

Important points about recursive function calls:

- Termination condition : to prevent infinite loop
- Recursive calls : to actually make the function recursive, calls the same function with a different parameter
- Remaining stuff... : do remaining stuff.

In a doubly linked list, you insert the `new_node` between two nodes. To do this, you must properly manage the next and prev of the new node.

## Tree Data Structure

Access time of a linked list is a problem for large amounts of data.

So we need a data structure that has a faster run time for all operations.

> Recursive definition of trees:

> A tree T is a collection of nodes connected by edges.

> - Base case: T is empty
> - Recursive definition: if not empty, a tree T consists of

>   - a root node r
>   - zero or more non-empty sub-trees: T1, T2, ...., Tk

Length of a path: how many edges that is in the path. Example: A-E-J-Q, length is 3.

Depth : root to a node, how many edges do you pass through

Height: from a certain node to leaf (deepest node)

Height of a tree:

- height of the root
- depth of a deepest leaf.

Binary tree: each node has <=2 children.|
