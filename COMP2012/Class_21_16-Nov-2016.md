# Continuing on Inheritance

Change the keyword to change type of inheritance.

- `public`
- `private`
- `protected`

When we check the restrictiveness of inheritance, as in if we use it in the derived class inside a member function, we should observe its access rights from class above.

Slicing problem won't happen on pointers and references.

Liskov substitution principle is only possible with `public` inheritance not with any other modes of inheritance.

## Polymorphism: Dynamic Binding & Virtual Function

- Poly: multiple
- Morphism: shape

Polymorphism definition: something that is very similar, but in fact they are different things.

Example:

- Function overloading
- Function overriding
- Template

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in A" <<endl;
        }
        //BUT IF YOU DO THIS:
        // virtual void func() {...}
};

class B : public A {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in B" <<endl;
        }
};

int main() {
    A* aPtr = new B;
    aPtr->func(); //The function that is called is the one in A
    // IF VIRTUAL IS USED, THEN THE FUNCTION CALLED WILL BE B's FUNC
}
```

If there is a `virtual` keyword, then the function that is being called won't just be directly based on the type of the object itself.

If the function in the base class is `virtual` then the derived class's function is also `virtual` even though there is no `virtual` keyword there. It is automatically a `virtual` function.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    public:
        virtual void func() {
            cout<<"func() in A" <<endl;
        }
};

class B : public A {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in B" <<endl;
        }
};

class C : public B {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in C" <<endl;
        }
};

int main() {
    B* bPtr = new C;
    bPtr->func(); //THE ONE THAT IS CALLED IS THE ONE IN C
    //func() in B is a virtual function, as it is virtual in A
    //Meaning, in C it is also virtual.
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in A" <<endl;
        }
};

class B : public A {
    public:
        virtual void func() {
            cout<<"func() in B" <<endl;
        }
};

class C : public B {
    public:
        void func() {
            cout<<"func() in C" <<endl;
        }
};

int main() {
    A* aPtr = new C;
    aPtr->func();
    //Still calls A's function
}
```

Static binding means that which function that is called is determined during compilation.

Dynamic binding means that which function that is called is determined during runtime.
