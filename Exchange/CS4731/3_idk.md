## Review
Iterative deepening: a limited depth first search, search with DFS to a certain depth. (BFS combined with DFS)

Admissible heuristics never **overestimate**

Benefits of grid representation:
- Easier to search through
- Tends to work better with algorithms like A*, as heuristics are easy in this context.
