# Dynamic Movement
Accelerate in direction of target until maximum velocity is achieved.

## Dynamic Seek
Same notion as kinematic seek, match position of character with target.

The difference is in velocity and acceleration.

## Combining Steering Behaviour
- Arbitration: tie-breaking of certain behaviour that might cause problems when they're together. Sort of a rule-based technique, when a and b are in conflict, and it's in some situation, prioritise something based on the rule.
