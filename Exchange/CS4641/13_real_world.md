# Real World Applications of ML: NLP and Data Mining

## NLP
NLP Problems:
- User Reviews : Sentiment Analysis
- Personal Assistant : Question Answering
- Image Description : seq-to-seq classification
- HW Description - Answer : Dialogue
- Translation : Translation (relatable to seq-to-seq or question answering)

Local coherency isn't enough to find out the meaning behind things.

How to fix NLP? Words are bad!
- PoS tags (part of speech tags)
- Bag of Words
  - inverse document frequency (idf)

### Machine Translation
Treated as a classification task or sequence to sequence classification.

### Chatbots
- Slotfilling: they understand several phrases, and then they fill in some slots based on what you said.
- Dialogue Generation: generate a believable dialogue

## Data Mining

Not actually mining for data, instead we mine for solution, pattern or insight from the data.
