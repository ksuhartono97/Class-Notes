## Definition of Machine Learning

Machine learning is composed of:

- Supervised learning : input and output
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning : learning a transition function to maximize reward

### Supervised Learning

Is an approximation, can never be completely perfect.

### Unsupervised Learning

Commonly referred to as clustering, as in given instances, classify it into classes.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reward based. Need to maximize reward.

## When and Why to Apply ML

Example : the netflix problem, suggest a movie or something to watch for the user.

Previously watched (history), what can be obtained from it:

- Tags
- Duration
- Frequency

To give the next suggestion, decision trees can be used

### ML approach is not working!

- You can narrow down the representation by combining the input, or reduce the number of inputs. For example, combining tags and duration, or tags and frequency. Or representation through frequency only.
- Check for bias in data.
- Check assumptions about "working"
