## Expectation Maximization

Exercise:
- No, if initialization is random, then the algo is not deterministic. Note that if there is any randomness, it won't be deterministic.

## Clustering Approach Properties
- Richness: can get any possible clustering given any set of points given the correct distance function.

## Feature Selection

Relevance vs Usefulness: usefulness: an objective notion that we can test, whether a feature is useful to a certain classifier. Relevance: is more of a notion, assuming a perfect classifier, we test whether adding a certain feature in this case could improve accuracy or not.
