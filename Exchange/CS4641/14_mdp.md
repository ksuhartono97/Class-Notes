# Markov Decision Processes

## Reinforcement Learning
Basically generate a set of steps that maximize the reward.

Markov Chains:
- There are states
- There are transitions so we can move from state to state (also stay in the state itself)
- There are probabilities assigned to the state transitions.
- All probabilities of arrows moving out of a state (transitions) sum to 1

The markovian assumption: the next state transition only depends on the current state.
