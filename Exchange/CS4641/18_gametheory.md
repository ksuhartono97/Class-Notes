# Game Theory
A way of modelling interaction between agents, not necessarily an accurate model for real world interactions.

Rational: trying to optimize the rewards given.

Exercise:
- Value Iteration: values of areas near the red zones and green zones may not be as optimum as there may be cases when an agent blocks the other from entering the exit state, causing them to just walk around trying to avoid the exit state. Meaning that the resulting values may not converge to the "most optimum" values.
- Q-learning: same case with value iteration, a path that is not the best path will reach the result.

Actual answers:
- Basically both will converge eventually but will take much much longer.

Exercise 2:
- Yes
- Yes
- No
- Yes
- No

Nash equilibrium: if one player is asked to change their strategy, they would have no reason to change.
