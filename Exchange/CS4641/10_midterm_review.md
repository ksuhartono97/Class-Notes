# Midterm Review

## Decision Tree
- Each step of the learning period adds extra nodes along the way

## Neural Networks
- Slow to train, fast to run
- Can handle regression and classification
- The neural network is static, the size is unchanged.

### Exercise
- Decision Trees
- Neural network
- Decision Tree
  - 1-5 stars: classification
  - Variable length (user input can be different in length): decision tree
  - Many useless features in info: DT (DT can remove useless features better)

## Instance Based Learning
- No training time, but test time is long
- Perfect training error, but overfits terribly.

## SVM
- Needs to be linearly separable

## Bayesian Learning
