Civil rights act of 1866: anyone born in the US is considered a US citizen. Caused slaves to be illegal.

14th amendment: equal protection of the law

First KKK: the rise of KKK in the south is a threat to reconstruction in the US.

Enforcement Acts of 1870-71: KKK activity illegal,

# Technological Breakthroughs
Transportation: steamships, canals, and trains/railroads.

> John Stevens, father of locomotive

Communication: Samuel Morse made the telegraph, is how Western Union came around. Telephone.

Manufacturing:
- Textile machinery, it was really labour intensive to process cotton.
- Blast furnaces, can make steel, was revolutionary as it enabled steel constructions such as railroads, trains, etc.
- Electric power: enables 24 hours operation of factories, activities and production no longer stop when night-time comes.

DC (Direct Current): DC is great but it's transmission range is very short, making it not practical to use DC everywhere. That is why transformers were used to convert DC to AC so that the power can be transported around.

## Emergence of Mass Retailers
- Mail Order Houses: carried all variety of products.
- Chain stores: did a lot to contribute to the modernization of agriculture.
- Department stores

In big cities you can get all of these, in smaller cities you'll surely still get chain stores and mail order houses, and in rural areas you'll have access to mail order houses catalogues.

The rise of mass retailers presented americans with the opportunity to shop like never before.

>laissez-faire = let be

## Efforts at railroad regulation
RR industry: railroad industry.

Farmers organized into the Grange (an organization of farmers) and they requested the government to regulate the railroads.

## Supreme Court and railroad regulation
Railroad attorneys argue that state governments should not be allowed to regulate interstate commerce as they are supposed to regulate intrastate commerce. This caused federal government to reverse the act.

## Federal Regulatory Legislation
- Interstate Commerce Act: created the ICC to federally regulate interstate commerce

## The Robber Barons
JP Morgan: kingpin of banking and finance.

## Oil and Kerosene
Oil and kerosene was a big industry as Americans didn't have access to electricity until the 20th century.

## Vertical Integration
Carnegie took over other industries in the same supply chain to control production and prices.  

## Horizontal Integration
The idea is a corporation gets bigger by buying out or taking over competition to ensure monopoly.

This is good for companies because of "efficiencies of scale",

# U.S. Economic Growth
US became the world's largest economy in 35 years which is a short amount of time in history's terms. This is due to the technological advances paving the way (telephones, textile machines, blast furnaces.)

"Filthy rich" made wealth from a dirty unscrupulous way.

## Working conditions in the late-nineteenth century
- 6 day work weeks, from 10-14 hours a day
- No minimum wage law: didn't exist until 1930, cheapest labour is child labour these days. If it's a job anyone can do, can just hire a child and save costs.
- No overtime pay
- No workplace safety law or worker's compensation: if anything happens then, too bad, nothing will be done by the company.
- No benefits

## Labour unions
- Knights of Labour: Recognised differences in sex, and amount of work put, races, etc. Only mostly prejudiced against Chinese workers. Chinese immigrants had a lot of prejudice in the US. This is due to the Chinese workers taking jobs with lower wages compared to Americans. However any worker can join the union, due to their believe that as long as all the skilled workers are together, they can stand up against the companies.
- American Federation of Labour:

## Great Railroad Strike of 1877
Done to protest wages that was cut by RR companies.

Sketches are usually used to record rioting or fast movement scenes, as cameras are unable to take pictures like that.

The whole era 87-89 was a pattern of riots. There are many riots that occured between workers and troops.

## Haymarket Riot (May 1866)
Mayday or May 1st was a one day strike to pressure the state to give 8 hours work day. These people got broken up by the police, so they did another demonstration to protest the police breaking them up. Which led to another demonstration, which led to violence and death of police and demonstrators.

Gave labour unions a bad image.

## Homestead Strike
Carnegie's business partner was forcing steel workers to take a 10% wage cut and tried to break the worker's union. Carnegie hired the Pinkertons (private armed guards) to scare away the workers. However, the workers were keeping watch, and when they saw the Pinkertons, a shootout ensued causing 10 people to be killed in a couple of hours.

## Pullman Strike of 1894
At this period there is another great depression. American economy was a period of boom and buzz periods, where when it's the buzz period, workers would lose their jobs.

Basically same thing happened again, strikers complaining about wage cuts, then ARU refused to service Pullman railways. Which then caused the company to lobby the state who then mobilized troops to disperse the strike.

Everytime a strike gets too big, there's gonna be state troops or national troops sent to disperse the strike.

# The New South and The New West
The west was dangerous due to the need to use the trail (going by foot), there are still a lot of tribes.

## Henry Grady and the New South Creed
- Diversification of agriculture: rice, tobacco, and cotton other crop are the 3 cache crops in the south. These were the profitable crops, but after war the prices started dropping. To improve economy, they need to expand what they plant and diversify it.
- Peaceful race elections: speaking out against the mobs and violence in elections. This was a picture of how he wants the South to revitalize itself after the war. Trying to attract capital from the North.

## Late 19th century southern industries
- Cotton mills: a major industry, there are many cotton mills in the south. Were a pretty cheap way to reindustrialize the south. Built because there were a lot of cotton being grown. So that they can process the cotton instead of shipping it to other countries to process to cloth.
- Coal mining: works in places that has coal in the ground (obviously)
- Tobacco Manufacturing: Tennesee, Kentucky, etc.
- Iron and Steel: mostly in Birmingham

A lot of cotton mills stayed around until late 19th century, they got shut down by international trade, when stuff were getting imported.

## Postbellum southern farmers
- Planters: planters with large plantations
- Small landowners : basically middle class, can support families fairly well but not very wealthy, but independent.
- Tenant farmers: almost in poverty
- Sharecroppers: in poverty, they had nothing except of clothes and labour, owned no land, and can't afford to rent.

## Bourbons / Redeemers
The democrats who took control of southern politics are mostly the wealthy whites, due to the immense wealth that they have, and they represented the interests of planters and industrialists.

## Rise of Jim Crow (racial segregation)
Jim Crow was an expression for black man.

"Separate but equal" but in reality, the facilities were always racially separate, but never fully equal.

The whole country saw the south as backwards due to all these segregation laws.

## Disfranchisement
15th amendment : no citizen shall be denied the right to vote based on race, color or previous servitude.

Mississippi Plan:
- Residency requirement: need to live in a state for 2 years to be able to vote, sounds reasonable but hard for sharecroppers, due to the fact that they may have to move yearly to find jobs.
- Poll tax: not too feasible for sharecroppers too
- Literacy test: can be rigged to make it easier for well known people.

"Grandfather clause": if your grandfather fought for the confederates in the war, then you can vote. Meaning that poor whites can vote if their grandfather fought for the confederates.

## Williams vs Mississippi
Supreme court upheld the Mississippi Disfranchisement plans, even though it was a clear violation of the 15th amendment. This is because the letter of the law did not contain anything that violates the 15th amendment, however the intent of the law was to being racist against the black men.

# Settlement of the New West

## Postbellum western industries
- Mining
- Cattle raising and herding
  - Invention of barbed wire: became an effective way to fence in animals so that these animals don't wander off somewhere
- Farming: midwestern droughts caused people to move, but it still didn't work.

## Battle of the Little Big Horn, 1876
The last of the American Indians (less than 10000). An American colonel, George Armstrong Custer tried to take land from these indians because their burial grounds had gold. The government tried to make an agreement with the Sioux, but to no avail. So the army had to stay there to try and trespass into the Sioux territory, which resulted in small skirmishes between the US military and the Sioux Indians. Eventually Custer and his regiment was annihilated by the Indians.

This war was so infamous because usually wars ended with a white flag on one side, which then causes the rest of the survivors to be taken captive as prisoners of war. However in this battle, everyone on the US side was annihilated.

This started the Great Sioux War, where the Americans wins because they basically overrunned and outnumbered the indians.

## Battle of the Wounded Knee, 1890
The last major dance between the US and the Indians. The Indians did a Ghost Dance, but the US army officers couldn't understand what this dance meant. But they eventually interpreted it as a pre-war dance. Thus they asked the Indians to stop, however the Indians instead invited more tribes and taught them the dance.

No one was really sure who fired first, someone on one side fired first and caused the battle to break loose. But basically what happened was the Dakota warriors were trying to convince the other Indians to stop the Ghost Dance to surrender. However, the US army misinterpreted this as the Dakota coming to prepare for war, which led to the attack on the Indians.

## Dawes Severalty Act, 1877
Tries to let the Indians keep what land they have left, and not to get shook out of their remaining land. The issue was that the Native Americans weren't smart enough to understand the concept of land ownership.

It was unsuccessful, as the native American landowners actually sold a lot of their claims to other people. The intent of the act was to help the Indians, but for 47 years,

# Gilded Age Politics and Culture
Gilded age is an era from the 1870s to 1890s. Something is gilded means it's covered with thin layers of gold.

## Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
Prohibited Chinese immigration to the USA, but students lobbied the US Congress to lift this restriction. They eventually lifted it on the 1943. This is because Pearl Harbour recently happened and all of a sudden the Japanese became the bad enemy, but the Chinese seemed more supportive of the US, so they became more inclined to lift said ban.

## Social Darwinism
Herbert Spencer, a philosopher/scientist starts to apply Darwin's theory of evolution to human society. He argued that rich people got rich because they deserve to be (more hard working, more talented), while people became poor because they deserved it (too lazy, not talented, etc).

## Characteristics of Gilded Age Politics
- High level of political participation (80% voter turnout): unlike now, where there are barely 50% voter turnout. A way of saying that Americans have more faith in politics then rather than now
- Close balance of power b/w the two major parties
- Weakness of the presidency: a lot of mediocre, forgotten presidents at this period.
- Corrupt elections: rampant at this period

## Major Political Issues in the Gilded Age
1. Sectionalism
2. Tariffs: there are a lot of tariffs that are paid by the consumer instead of the actual parties who should pay it. Tariffs on import and other stuff were taken away when trade organizations came around. And this made it cheaper to import stuff from outside rather than produce it in the US.
3. Civil Service Reform: a lot of jobs were given to people who helped in the election of a figure.
4. Money/Currency: the most complicated issue of this era. At this period they try to differentiate currency material, such as "hard money" where the material of a coin is gold and that is what gave that currency value.

## Economic Problems facing farmers in the Gilded Age
1. Falling Crop Prices
2. Rising business costs
3. Crop lien system in the South

## Farmers Organize
- The Grange (1867 - present) :
- Farmers Alliance: wanted
  - Elimination of middlemen in business
  - Railroad regulation
  - Free coinage of silver: means that they want the government to buy all the silver it could and mint them into coins and put it into the market. This is because they thought it would ease their fees, make it easier to get loans, and create inflation.

## Election of 1896
A pivotal election.

## 1890s American Imperialism
Imperialism in this case is just territorial expansion.

Motivations:
- Nationalism: coming out of the civil war, US was not a major world power. While other world powers like Britain and Germany are building empires, so they want to follow suit.
- Racism
- Christian missionary zeal: wanted to expand christianity
- Economic ambitions: wanted to be a part of trade.

## Hawaii
McKinley Tariff of 1890: wiped the free tariff on sugar from Hawaii, this tariff created an import tariff to all sugar brought into US. This put American sugar planters in Hawaii in jeopardy.

Thus the 1893 Revolution staged by the American sugar planters demanding annexation to the US.

But annexation didn't happen till 1898

## Roots of the Spanish-American War
Cuban rebellion began in 1895

American "yellow journalism": sensationalized coverage on the stuff happening in Cuba. Causing Americans to be more sympathetic towards Cuba and more hostile towards Spain.

In March 1897, McKinley asked Spain to grant Cuba independence, but Spain refused. At this point Spain had a large empire in the world.

## The de Lome letter
Letter by a Spanish diplomat that was stolen and published in the New York Journal that described McKinley as a "weak and opportunistic leader". Creating more fuel for the fire of hate for Spain.

## U.S.S. Maine
Sent to Havana to guards interests of the US and US citizens in Cuba. Exploded and sank, killing 266 Americans personnel, causing even more American outrage. However, the cause of the explosion is never actually clear. Before the investigation is complete, people already blamed Spain for the destruction of the Maine.

## Beginning of the Spanish American War
So the above were events leading to the start of the war.

US will not annex Cuba at the end of the war.

## Back in Cuba
Biggest problem US army in Cuba is disease, and tainted American canned meat which caused many US soldiers to die.

## Treaty of Paris
- Cuba became a protectorate of the US.
- US paid Spain to take control of the Philippines: the Filipinos thought the US came to liberate them, but when they realized this treaty, the Filipinos began to rebel again.

## Filipino insurrection
Is an undeclared war, was won by the US who were much better equipped, and the Americans were using illegal interrogation methods.

## Panama Canal
Would help the US navy get around from the East and West coast. And US navy had more naval bases setup so the canal would make more sense.

Thus the US started to negotiate with Columbia, however Columbia raised prices at the last minute. Therefore Teddy Roosevelt decided to start a revolution in Panama, then struck a deal with them to build the canal.

## Results of 1890s/1900s American Imperialism
- Tropical diseases were a major thing, so they realized that they need to solve this problem, when they go to tropical locations, they first start a mosquito eradication and do disease prevention measures.
- Was poised to become a world power in the 20th century, however US became more vulnerable to being attacked by foreign powers.

# The Progressive Moevement
A series of reform movements that was sort of a reaction to the industrialization age.

## Coal miners' strike of 1902
Roosevelt settled this strike by mediating and threatening to federalize the coal mines when the mining co. presidents wouldn't accept his offer.

## Consumer Safety Reforms
- Pure Food and Drug Act: means that all ingredients need to be labelled on the packaging, so that there is no illegal ingredients on the food/drink/medicine. Is kind of the start of the war on drugs.

## Hepburn Act
Passed by congress, and signed by Roosevelt. Gave the ICC the power to effectively regulate railroads, such as setting rates so that railroads can't charge more than the set rate. Requested by farmers so that they can ship crops at a better rate.

## "Trustbusting"
Theodore Roosevelt enforced the Sherman Antitrust Act.
- US vs Standard Oil : Standard oil controlled 90% of the US oil industry.

Trustbusting in a sense means government activities in trying to break up trusts and monopolies by industries, such as the one by Standard Oil.

## Election of 1908
Roosevelt basically handpicked Taft to succeed him.

## Mann-Elkins Act of 1910
Extended the ICC's regulatory jurisdiction to telephone and telegraph companies. Is like part 2 of Hepburn Act, and was demanded by the Farmers Alliance again. They were so concerned about this is because Farmers need to use phones and telegraphs a lot.

## Election of 1912
Between Taft, Roosevelt, Wilson, and Debs. Taft republican, Roosevelt third party, Wilson Democrat, and Debs socialist.

Wilson argued that trustbusting needs to happen more, he promoted more antimonopoly, anti wall st.

Wilson won with a sweep.

## Underwood-Simmons Tariff
Is the first major tariff reduction since the Civil War, Wilson's argument is that this would be good for the economy since it would lower the prices that have to be paid. He viewed tariffs as a corporate privilege that reduced competition.

## Federal Reserve Act of 1913
Created the national banking system of today. In the late 19th century the economy was a boom-bust cycle. And also there was the currency issue. So this was created to solve those economy issues. This was designed to provide for more effective control of the money supply and bank credit. They can control how much money is in circulation. The idea is for this to prevent the boom and bust economy cycle.

## Progressive Amendments:
- 16th : Federal income tax. Tariffs were the biggest source of federal income.
- 17th : State legislators chose the senators before, so there is a lot of opportunities for corruption. So this allowed Direct Election os US Senators
- 18th: Prohibition
- 19th: Women's suffrage, women gets to vote.
