# SCM & Git
Version control, so you can have backups as disk is cheap.

## SVN
`svn update` and `svn commit` are the two most important commands in SVN.

- `svn update` similar to `git pull`
- `svn add` similar to `git add` for adding files. So you can choose the files you are going to add.
- `svn diff` gives you the changes you made.
- `svn commit` is `git push`

## Git
You should know the git workflow already if you're looking at this.
