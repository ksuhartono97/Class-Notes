# Design principles
Types of work
- Code and Fix
- Waterfall : high risk on the changes. Because we probably can't accommodate the changes
- Prototype : Making a prototype to communicate customer, if they are happy then you can continue the progress. (looks like a circle)
- Spiral : can reduce risk, but need a real expert in identifying and dealing with risk
- Phased : release software bit by bit, release functionalities bit by bit, and fix problems.
- Agile : bring clients into the team and collaborate all the way. Respond to change as needed. Individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change are the four important manifestos.

Extreme Programming, you work on the whole software development process in a day.

Test Driven Development: write test cases before implementing, then run the tests, then you implement code to pass test case, then when code passes, upgrade test cases, repeat gradually, eventually it will be finished product.

## Comparison  agile and waterfall
Criticality, is it important or not. If it is, use waterfall, if not use agile. More senior developers means agile, juniors means waterfall. Chaotic and many changes use agile, more ordered use waterfall.
