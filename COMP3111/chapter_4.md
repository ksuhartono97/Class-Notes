# Requirements Engineering

Requirement is very difficult to write because brain is optimistic. One of the best ways to write a requirement is to divide and conquer.

## Type Of Requirements

- User Requirements : Are typically generalised, more vague.
- System Requirements :Are more detailed than user requirements, can be used by the developers to implement the software.
- Functional Requirements : A list of features that is expected to be implemented that the user can use.
- Non-functional Requirements : Are a list of the constraints that are going to be a problem for the functions that we want to implement.

Requirements can be imprecise. Causing them to be unclear and making it hard to understand.A solution for this is to be as complete and consistent as possible.
