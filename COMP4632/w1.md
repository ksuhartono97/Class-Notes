ESXi base is a hardened version of linux. That is bare-metal or any extra features are removed.

In a real situation, the windows 7 is in a physical machine and the ESXi server is also running on a physical machine. So we will be running a virtual client to connect to the ESXi server.

For thick provisioning, we will pre allocate 1GB from host. While for thin provisioning, it will dynamically enlarge hard disk according to usage until it reaches the amount you specified. Lazy zeroed it will not erase the preallocated space, that is it will preallocate but it won't write anything into the space. For eager zeroed, it will zero out (clear out) the space as it preallocates.
